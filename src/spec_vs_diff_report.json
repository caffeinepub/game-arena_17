  "summary": "The diff implements a playable 2D obstacle-avoidance game with keyboard controls, scoring, and backend high score persistence. It includes a cohesive visual theme with custom color palette and typography. However, the backend implementation has significant issues (incorrect Motoko syntax, non-functional logic), and the required generated image assets are not present in the diff.",

      "reason": "The backend/main.mo file uses invalid Motoko syntax (e.g., List.empty, List.add, List.filter methods) and patterns that do not match the mo:core library API. The BuildRequest specified single-actor Motoko backend, but the implementation would not compile or function. This represents hallucinated/broken functionality not requested in the spec.",

      "reason": "The backend includes a play() method that unconditionally calls Runtime.trap() with a Game Over message. This was not requested in any requirement and serves no valid purpose in the gameplay architecture.",
