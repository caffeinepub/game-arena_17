# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create an interactive 2D game with gameplay mechanics, score tracking, and visual assets.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement playable game with user controls (keyboard/mouse input)
- Add win/loss conditions or scoring system with real-time updates
- Create visual theme with cohesive colors, typography, and layout
- Implement score tracking with backend persistence for high scores
- Display current score during gameplay and show high score
- Integrate generated game assets (background, player sprite, game elements)

**User-visible outcome:** Users can play an interactive game with controls, see their score update in real-time, and have their high scores saved between sessions in a visually engaging interface.
